# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the DeadW3 community pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community dedicated to preserving cultural heritage for all.

- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community and the cultural preservation mission
- **Showing appreciation** for contributors' efforts and acknowledging their work
- **Being patient** with those learning new technologies or contributing for the first time

## Project-Specific Standards

In addition to general community standards, DeadW3 contributors should uphold these project-specific values:

### Respect for Cultural Heritage

- **Honor the spirit** of archival preservation and the Grateful Dead community's values of sharing and accessibility
- **Respect copyright** and licensing requirements; never upload or advocate for uploading content that violates intellectual property rights
- **Maintain accuracy** in metadata and avoid deliberately introducing false or misleading information
- **Acknowledge provenance** and give credit to original tapers, digitizers, and archivists

### Technical Integrity

- **Act in good faith** when reviewing code, raising issues, or providing feedback
- **Do not deliberately introduce** security vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code
- **Report security issues responsibly** through proper channels rather than public disclosure
- **Avoid gaming incentive systems** such as submitting duplicate content or manipulating verification scores

### Constructive Collaboration

- **Focus on ideas, not individuals** when disagreeing with technical approaches
- **Document decisions** and rationale to help future contributors understand context
- **Welcome newcomers** and help them onboard to the project
- **Share knowledge** through clear documentation, helpful code comments, and patient mentoring

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Discord server and voice channels
- Email communications with project maintainers
- Project-related events, whether virtual or in-person
- Social media when representing the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@deadw3.org**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Description of the incident, including date and time
- Links to relevant conversations or content
- Any additional context that may be helpful

### Confidentiality

Reports will be handled with discretion. We will not identify reporters to alleged violators without consent, except when we believe it is legally required or necessary to prevent imminent harm.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal by:

1. Sending a detailed explanation to **appeals@deadw3.org** within 30 days of receiving notice
2. Including any relevant context or evidence supporting your position
3. Awaiting review by community leadership (excluding those involved in the original enforcement decision)

Appeal decisions are final. The appeals process focuses on ensuring enforcement was procedurally fair and proportionate to the violation, not relitigating the incident itself.
