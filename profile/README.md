# **DeadW3: Decentralized Archive Preservation Protocol**

*A Whitepaper and Technical Specification*

---

## **Abstract**

The DeadW3 project aims to create a decentralized, censorship-resistant preservation system for cultural archives, starting with the **Grateful Dead live music recordings** currently hosted on Archive.org. By combining **Arweave’s permanent storage**, **Ethereum-compatible smart contracts**, and **AI-assisted verification**, DeadW3 establishes a sustainable framework for archiving public digital heritage.

The technology, governance, and incentive systems described here form the foundation of a future **Archive.org Mirror Protocol** capable of safeguarding the wider Live Music Archive, Wayback Machine, and other key cultural repositories.

---

## **1. Mission and Vision**

### **Mission Statement**

> To ensure that the world’s cultural and digital memory — from music to the web itself — outlives the platforms that host it.

### **Vision**

A decentralized ecosystem where archivists, curators, and AI agents collaborate to mirror and preserve humanity’s shared history in permanent, verifiable form.

### **Initial Focus**

- **Pilot Collection:** Grateful Dead live recordings from Archive.org’s “Grateful Dead” collection.
- **Long-Term Goal:** Expand into a full **Archive.org Mirror Network** preserving multiple cultural domains (music, books, websites, etc.).

---

## **2. Core Principles**

- **Permanence:** Store data forever on Arweave.
- **Integrity:** Verify authenticity through cryptographic and AI-based analysis.
- **Transparency:** Record metadata, provenance, and verification results on-chain.
- **Community Ownership:** Governed by a DAO, not a single entity.
- **Open Access:** All archives remain freely accessible for non-commercial use.

---

## **3. System Architecture**

### **3.1 Overview**

The DeadW3 protocol consists of five interacting layers:

1. **Storage Layer:** Arweave + Bundlr (permanent decentralized storage)
2. **Verification Layer:** AI + LLM pipeline ensures data integrity and policy compliance
3. **Blockchain Layer:** Ethereum-compatible contracts on Base network manage submissions, staking, and rewards
4. **Index Layer:** Arweave GraphQL + Postgres indexer for metadata search and retrieval
5. **Application Layer:** Web app, API, and DAO interfaces for users and curators

## **4. Technical Components**

### **4.1 Storage Layer (Arweave)**

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Arweave** | Permanent decentralized data storage |
| **Bundlr** | Scalable Arweave upload gateway |
| **ANS-104 Manifest** | Defines relationships between audio, documents, and metadata |
| **Arweave Tags** | Store key metadata (date, venue, lineage, checksum, license) |

**Example Tags:**

```
App-Name: deadw3-archive
Band: Grateful Dead
Show-Date: 1977-05-08
Venue: Barton Hall
City: Ithaca
Country: USA
Source: AUD
Rights: NonCommercial-ShareAlike
Checksum: 0x1234abcd...
```

---

### **4.2 Verification Layer (AI Agent)**

**Purpose:** Automate the validation of uploaded archives to ensure integrity, compliance, and originality.

**Components:**

- `blake3` tree hashing for file integrity
- `chromaprint` audio fingerprinting for duplicate detection
- `librosa` and `soundfile` for audio quality analysis
- LLM text reasoning for lineage normalization and rights compliance
- Structured JSON report pinned to Arweave

**Verification Workflow:**

1. Fetch ANS-104 manifest and tags
2. Validate checksums (`ffp.txt` vs computed)
3. Extract and normalize metadata
4. Perform audio and policy checks
5. Generate structured verification report
6. Submit `ShowVerified` event on Base chain

**Sample JSON Report:**

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "arweaveTxId": "abc123",
  "metadata": {"date": "1977-05-08", "venue": "Barton Hall"},
  "integrity": {"ffp": "PASS", "hashMismatches": []},
  "audioQuality": {"sampleRate": 48000, "clipping": false},
  "duplication": {"dupScore": 0.83},
  "policy": {"risk": 0},
  "scores": {"overall": 95},
  "verdict": "AUTO_ACCEPT"
}
```

---

### **4.3 Blockchain Layer (Base Network)**

| Contract | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **DEADW3 Token** | ERC-20 reward and governance token |
| **ShowRegistry** | Records uploads, hashes, verification reports |
| **RewardDistributor** | Manages staking, rewards, and slashing |
| **GovernanceDAO** | Controls parameters, treasury, and curation rules |

**Key Struct:**

```solidity
struct Show {
    address uploader;
    string arweaveTxId;
    bytes32 rootHash;
    uint32 dateYMD;
    uint8 status;
    uint8 aiScore;
}
```

---

### **4.4 Index Layer**

- **Postgres** stores verified metadata for fast search.
- **Arweave GraphQL (ArDB)** provides public query access.
- **Duplicate detection**: use `BLAKE3` + `Chromaprint` fingerprints.
- **API Endpoints:** `/shows`, `/artists`, `/venues`, `/verify`.

---

### **4.5 Application Layer**

- **Frontend:** Next.js + shadcn UI with dark/light themes.
- **Features:** Upload wizard, curator dashboard, AI report viewer, streaming player.
- **Auth:** Farcaster or Ethereum wallet (via RainbowKit).
- **Extra:** Farcaster Frame integration for sharing shows.

## **5. Tokenomics**

### **5.1 Token Overview**

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Token Symbol | $DEADW3 |
| Network | Base |
| Standard | ERC-20 (mintable) |
| Max Supply | 100,000,000 |
| Initial Distribution | See below |

### **5.2 Allocation**

| Category | Percentage | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upload Rewards | 50% | Reward verified uploads |
| Verifier/Curator Rewards | 20% | Reward AI operators + human curators |
| DAO Treasury | 15% | Fund operations + storage AR purchases |
| Ecosystem Growth | 10% | Partnerships, grants, hackathons |
| Founders + Early Devs | 5%  | Initial dev and bootstrap allocation |

### **5.3 Emission Model**

- Token emissions occur per verified upload.
- Reward per upload decays over time (early archivists earn more).
- Verifiers earn proportional to AI accuracy and approval rate.
- Treasury buys AR tokens for ongoing storage sustainability.

### **5.4 Utility**

- Staking for curator role and governance votes.
- Payment for optional AI verification services (cross-archive future).
- Reputation weight in decentralized verification DAOs.

---

## **6. DAO Governance Configuration**

### **DAO Type:** Multi-tier Hybrid DAO

| Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Curator DAO** | Domain experts + verifiers approve final decisions |
| **Treasury DAO** | Controls DEADW3 treasury, AR purchases, grants |
| **Policy DAO** | Defines content compliance and license rules |
| **Root DAO** | Aggregates the above, governing cross-domain parameters |

**Implementation:**

- Initially 5/7 multisig (Safe) → transitions to on-chain governance (Aragon / DAOhaus).

**Voting Power:**

- 1 token = 1 vote (with delegated voting possible)
- Staked tokens yield reputation multipliers for verified contributions

**Proposal Types:**

1. Add/Remove Curator
2. Adjust reward ratios
3. Approve new Archive.org collections
4. Fund treasury actions or AR storage top-ups
5. Enact emergency delisting

---

## **8. Sustainability and Ethics**

- Respect all license terms and artist wishes.
- Maintain open-source verification code for transparency.
- Operate as a non-profit public goods protocol.
- Fund AR storage costs through DAO treasury and public donations.
- Encourage interoperability with Archive.org and related entities.

---

## **9. Risks & Mitigations**

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| **Legal disputes** | Restrict uploads to public domain or licensed works |
| **Sybil attacks** | Require staking and identity verification |
| **AI misclassification** | Human curator review and appeal process |
| **Funding shortages** | DAO-controlled AR buybacks and grants |
| **Duplicate spam** | Deduplication + staking-based deterrents |

---

## **10. Future Work**

- Implement modular AI verifier pipelines for multiple media types.
- Establish inter-DAO coordination for other archives (BooksDAO, WebDAO).
- Develop incentive bridges to Filecoin/IPFS nodes for redundancy.
- Introduce zkProofs for verifiable integrity reports.

---

## **11. Conclusion**

DeadW3 begins as an act of cultural preservation — saving the most documented live band in history — but evolves into a mission to safeguard all of humanity’s digital heritage. By merging decentralized storage, AI verification, and tokenized coordination, DeadW3 builds the framework for an **eternal, community-governed archive layer**.
