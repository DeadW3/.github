      placeholder: |
        Example: The README mentions setting up environment variables but doesn't list which variables are required or what values they should have. I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out the correct DATABASE_URL format.

        But it doesn't explain:
        - Which variables are required vs optional
        - What format each variable should use
        - Where to find values like API keys

        ```bash
        # Database (Required)
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/deadw3
