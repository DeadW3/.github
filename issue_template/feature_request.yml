      label: Problem Statement
      description: What problem would this feature solve? What's the use case?
      placeholder: |
        Example: As an uploader, I find it tedious to manually fill in metadata for each show. Many shows have similar patterns (same venue, same year, etc.) that could be auto-filled.

      required: true

    id: solution
    attributes:
      label: Proposed Solution
      description: How would you like to see this feature implemented?
      placeholder: |
        Example: Add a "Fill from previous show" button that copies metadata from the most recent submission, allowing quick editing of just the date and any unique details.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: alternatives
    attributes:
      label: Alternative Solutions
      description: Have you considered any alternative approaches?
      placeholder: |
        Example: 
        - Could use browser localStorage to remember last submission
        - Could implement batch upload for multiple shows at once
        - Could add metadata templates for common venue/date patterns
